OVERVIEW
--------
This represents the submission of the Zoom+Care Candidate Code Challenge by John Leinaweaver.

This project fulfills the requirement for two endpoints that provide a list of all
top-level employees or a specific employee.   The two endpoints are:

For top-level employees:
GET http://localhost:8080/employee

For an individual employee, queried by the employee's id (represented as "{id}":
GET http://localhost:8080/employee/{id}

Each employee, whether in the top level list, or an individual employee, includes the
employee's id, the employee's supervisor id, all the properties associated with the employee,
and a nested list of all direct reports for that employee.   This will create a deeply nested
structure of the organization.


STRUCTURE
---------
This project is organized into sub-packages representing functional areas, all under the
package name com.zoomcare.candidatechallenge.

config - contains the Bean and Constants definition.
controller - contains the REST Controller.
dao - contains the data access objects for the employee and property tables.
exception - contains exception classes.
model - contains the pojo representation for each employee and the employee's properties.
service - contains the code that drives the process from request response.

The main class for the project is CandidateChallengeApplication.

There is also a 'test' subdirectory under the src directory which contains junit
based unit tests.


DESIGN APPROACH
---------------
One decision this challenge presents is the approach to gather each employee's data from
the database and build up the nested structure of direct-reports.

This submission will require only 3 queries for a specific employee endpoint and
only 2 queries when the top-level endpoint is called.  This is true regardless of
the number of employees and number of properties per employee.  This minimizes the
network traffic between the application and database, improving the performance as the
database tables grow.

This submission utilizes recursive SQL to minimize the number of database calls when
gathering/building the direct-report structure.  Gathering the properties for all the
employees is also minimized to a single query, regardless of the number of employees
and properties.
